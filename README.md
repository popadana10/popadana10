Hey! I'm Dana. 👋

🚀 Besides my skills in UI/UX Design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Symfony and React I’m currently expanding my knowledge in Drupal, Redux, AWS, Quality Assurance, and CI/CD practices.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email at popa.dana100@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at Dana Mihaela Popa 📫

🖌️ Beyond coding, I enjoy short-form content creation for social media platforms. 

I’m always eager to explore new tools and techniques. ⚡
