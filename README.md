- 👋 Hi there, I’m @popadana10
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of art and technology, particularly through coding and creative projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying the fundamentals of coding, focusing on languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, Symfony, Drupal, as well as exploring UI/UX design principles.
- 💞️ I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can apply my coding skills in a creative and collaborative environment.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at popa.dana100@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://linkedin.com/in/dana-mihaela-popa .
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love experimenting with different art mediums, from traditional painting to digital illustration, and I'm always eager to learn new techniques and tools.
